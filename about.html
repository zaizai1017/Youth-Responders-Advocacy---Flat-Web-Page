      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Youth Responders Advocacy began in 2020, during a series of typhoons that hit the Philippines. A group of high school students in Davao City noticed how unprepared their communities were when emergencies struck. Without immediate access to medical responders, many neighbors had to wait long before receiving help. Moved by this need, the students decided to take first aid training and started teaching their peers, hoping to reduce the risk of losing lives while waiting for professional responders.</p>

      <p>What started as a small group project has now grown into a city-wide movement. With the support of teachers, health professionals, and local government, the advocacy has expanded to include workshops, simulation drills, and partnerships with organizations such as the Red Cross and UNICEF. Today, Youth Responders Advocacy continues to empower the Filipino youth to take action, stay prepared, and become life-savers in their communities.</p>

          <p><strong>I am Zaira Bravo</strong>, the leader of Youth Responders Advocacy. I was trained under the CDRRMO for community response and disaster preparedness. Through my training, I became more determined to become a responder so I can save lives and provide urgent first aid to people during emergencies. My goal is to inspire other youth to step up and take action, because preparedness can truly make the difference between life and death.</p>
