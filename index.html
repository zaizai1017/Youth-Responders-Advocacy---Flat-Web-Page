  <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>

  <p>According to Ritchie et al. (2022), around 40,000 to 50,000 people die each year because of natural disasters. Many of these deaths occur due to communities being unprepared for such events. Improving disaster preparedness is necessary to reduce the number of lives lost.</p>

  <p>According to the Davao City Central 911 Emergency Response Center – City Government of Davao (2024), Davao City is the only city nationwide with an operational 911 system. This shows that most areas in the country do not have immediate emergency response services. As a result, delays in medical help during emergencies may increase the risk of death.</p>

  <h2>What is Being Done?</h2>

  <p>The country is taking steps to improve disaster preparedness in order to reduce deaths caused by natural disasters. The government is conducting programs that train communities on disaster risk reduction and management. These initiatives help ensure that people become more prepared and capable during emergencies.</p>

  <p>The government has also started expanding the next-generation 911 system to other cities. This development allows faster and more reliable responses to emergency calls. With these advancements, delays in medical assistance can be significantly reduced.</p>

  <p>Programs are likewise being introduced to increase youth involvement in disaster preparedness and response. Organizations like UNICEF are engaging young people through training and awareness activities. These initiatives aim to transform inactive youth into active responders who can help protect and strengthen their communities.</p>

  <h2>Where We Come In</h2>
  <p>Our advocacy focuses on training the youth to respond to accidents and emergencies in their own communities. By learning proper first aid, disaster response, and preparedness skills, young people can become empowered agents of change who save lives and build resilient communities.</p>



  <h2>Call to Action</h2>
  <p>Join us in empowering the youth to be life-savers. Through proper training and preparedness, we can make our communities stronger and safer in times of crisis.</p>
